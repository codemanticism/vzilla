Currently supports versions until 0.5.

This updates the path for the session. To use V in a terminal session, just might just one want to type `source run.sh install 0.5`. 

This is how:

`source run.sh install 0.5` to install that version of V.

`source run.sh switch 0.5` to switch to that version of V.
